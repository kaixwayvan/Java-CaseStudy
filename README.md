## Overview  
This project is a **Bank System Simulation** designed to mimic the functionalities of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). It demonstrates the principles of **structured programming** using the Java programming language, as part of the curriculum for **Programming 3 (Java)**.  

The simulation includes common ATM functionalities such as account management, balance inquiry, deposits, and withdrawals.

## Objective  
The goal of this case study is to:  
- Implement a simulation of a **Bank System** using structured programming techniques.  
- Reinforce Java programming concepts, such as loops, conditionals, functions, and basic input/output.  
- Provide a real-world application of modular programming principles.
